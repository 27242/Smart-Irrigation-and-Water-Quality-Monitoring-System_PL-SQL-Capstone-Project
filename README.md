## Problem Overview

A PL/SQL-based system automates the monitoring and management of water for a vegetable garden. It uses simulated sensor data to track soil moisture and pH levels across different garden zones. The core innovation lies in its automated decision-making: using database triggers for instant critical alerts, stored procedures to generate optimal watering schedules, and functions to assess plant health. This moves gardening from a manual, scheduled routine to an efficient, data-driven, and preventive model, ensuring optimal plant growth while conserving water.
